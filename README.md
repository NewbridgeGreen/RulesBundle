RulesBundle
=============

The RuleBundle adds support for a database-backed rules engine in Symfony2.
It provides a flexible framework for rule management that aims to provide a simple
yet highly customisable solution to managing abstract logic that you need to apply
to objects without having to hardwire rules into your application.

Features include:

- Customisable Rules Engine to apply customisable logic to your objects
- Store and retrieve rules in MongoDB (TODO: Add ORM, CouchDB support)
- Unit tested

This bundle is developed in sync with [symfony's repository](https://github.com/symfony/symfony).

**There has been no testing against Symfony 2.0.x**
